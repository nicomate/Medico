Mental Health is an important health issue that is often overlooked and has an impact on all Australians. 
Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, people are now more than ever, socially isolated, and have a lack of social connections causing distress on one’s mental health especially those with small businesses. Medico allow users to be able to express feelings, thoughts and personal experiences with each other, but also health practitioners through a single platform.
